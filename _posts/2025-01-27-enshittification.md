sometimes i worry that things will never get that bad. like the whole political agenda is always going to be one of enshittification. its never going to quite reach the point where people get truly fed up. its just going to get that little bit worse, on and on and on, and never get better. we'll all just be paying that little bit more for what we used to get for free. fewer and fewer people are going to be able to live their lives, but there will always be that group that can, so nothing ever really changes. even as that group gets smaller and smaller, they will still be comfortable, so it never reaches a point of desperation, of change.
